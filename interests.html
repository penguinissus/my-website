                <h2>ALL THE THINGS I LIKE</h2>
                <p>
                    All the things I like is a playlist filled with jazz standards, 
                    mostly referencing <i>The Real Book</i>. 
                    The name "All the things I like" is a wordplay on my first favourite
                    jazz chart - "All the Thing You Are"

                <h2>BAND AND ORCH</h2>
                <p>
                    Contains all of my favourite works for concert band and orchestra. 
                    Including works from composers like Samuel Hazo and the GOAT Stravinsky.
                    BTW I currently play trombone and french horn in concerts band, jazz band, musical pit bands, 
                    and I used to play violin in orchestra.

                <h2>EEPY zzzz</h2>
                <p>
                    Everything I like from Studio Ghibili because Joe Hisaishi is the GOAT. 
                    This is just called eepy because this playlist contains all the sleepy music. 
                    I also play a lot of Studio Ghibili music with my quintet, it's our to go whenever we run out of ideas.

                <h2>FINE SHYT</h2>
                <p>
                    All the cantonese songs I listen to that reminds me of home, 
                    but they're not all on here because there's too much good cantonese music,
                    so I decided to include one song from every goated singer I've listened to.
