My personal website yay.  
This readme is mostly for all the custom fonts I've created.  

# CUSTOM FONTS?!?!!
Font no. 1:  
very ugly and is meant to mimic more accurate handwriting? Ended up using this font only for the title because its still more accurate to my true self.  
Font no. 2:  
Handwritten but with serif. I was gonna use this for basically all my text because I thought this looked better then the previous font but as proven by the internet, sans serif is always better. Also the spacings and everything isn't that well aligned with this font so it makes all the regular words hard to read.  
Font no. 3:  
A more aligned font and sans serif, so I went with this font for regular paragraphs. Then decided that numbers aren't that worthy and the free version of a font making website was missing a few symbols (like the @ symbol) so I replaced all the numbers with my own funny symbols.  
Here's what I replaced all my numbers with:  
0. @ symbol  
1. penguin  
2. heart  
3. skull  
4.  smiley face (but now that I think of it it looks kind of dead)  
5. music symbol (specifically 2 quavers (yes quavers) connected by the beam)  
6. the word teehee but in one symbol  
7. diode symbol like on a schematic  
8. yippee the word in a symbol  
9. a nut like nuts and bolts
